I'm a Reiki Practioner, freelance graphic designer, and a developer! After graduating from DigitalCrafts Coding Bootcamp and navigating back to the employment realm with all this Covid craziness, I'm finally glued back to my computer screen...thankfully! I'm also attending school for Software development as well, I don't think there is a such thing as learning too much! Being a jack of all trades is great, but my goal is to master a few things!ðŸ˜„

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning IT Automation w/Python, and have dared to dip my toe back into learning Java as well (just the big toe, working on the whole foot! lol)
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: sarinalyons@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have a scar...from a burn, from a very hot french toast stick. True story. Don't judge me.
