### Hi I'm Sarina 👋

<!--
**slyons777/slyons777** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

I'm a software developer, reiki practitioner, and a freelance graphic designer! After graduating from DigitalCrafts Coding Bootcamp and navigating back to the employment realm with all this Covid craziness, I'm finally glued back to my computer screen...thankfully! I'm also attending school for software development as well, I don't think there is a such thing as learning too much! Being a jack of all trades is great, but my goal is to master a few things!😄

- 🌱 I’m currently working to attain cloud certifications within both the AWS and Google Cloud Platform
- 📫 How to reach me: sarinalyons@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I have a scar...from a burn, from a very hot french toast stick. True story. Don't judge me.
